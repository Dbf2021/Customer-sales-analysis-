Maryam Ahmed — Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio.
I specialize in data cleaning, visualization, reporting, and data-driven insights using Excel, Python, Google Sheets, Google Colab, and Looker Studio.

This portfolio includes real projects demonstrating my skills and experience.

1. API Data Collection & Cleaning (COVID-19 Dataset)

Tools:
Python, Requests, Pandas, JSON 


Skills:
API extraction, JSON handling, data cleaning

This project demonstrates how I collected COVID-19 data from an API, saved the raw JSON (“Before”), cleaned the data, and transformed it into a structured CSV (“After”), ready for analysis.
